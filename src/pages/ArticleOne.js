            <h1>No-Class CSS Frameworks</h1>
            <p>I linked up Water.css not long ago as an interesting sort of CSS framework. No classes. You just use semantic HTML and get styles. Is that going to “scale” very far? Probably not, but it sure is handy for styling things quickly, where — of course — you’re writing semantic HTML but don’t need to care tremendously about the look, other than it should look as decent as it can with low effort.

            This week I saw MVP.css making the rounds. Same idea. There are a bunch more!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Water.css</li>
                <li>MVP.css</li>
                <li>AttriCSS</li>
                <li>awsm.css</li>
                <li>Bahunya</li>
                <li>holiday.css</li>
                <li>Markdown CSS</li>

            </ul>
           
            <p>Even Foundation, while being a big honkin’ framework, does some pretty decent stuff classless-ly.</p>
